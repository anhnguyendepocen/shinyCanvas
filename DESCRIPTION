Description: Create and customize an interactive canvas using the 'D3'
    JavaScript library and the 'htmlwidgets' package. The canvas can be used
    directly from the R console, from 'RStudio', in Shiny apps and R Markdown documents.
    When in Shiny the canvas is observed by the server and can be used as a functional
    slider to work in a two dimensional space.
